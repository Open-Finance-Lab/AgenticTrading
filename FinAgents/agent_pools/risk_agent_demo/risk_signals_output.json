  "agent_analysis": "Data quality check (critical)\n- The provided dataset snippets are incomplete/truncated:\n  - Prices/volume table is cut off after a single GOOGL row; other symbols\u2019 series are missing.\n  - The returns series is partial and inconsistent with the row count (index range 629\u20133764 vs. 625 observations).\n  - Portfolio weights are not provided; correlation requires per-symbol return matrix.\n- Result: I cannot compute numerically accurate metrics yet without the full time series (or a complete portfolio-return series) and weights.\n\nWhat I need to compute your metrics\n- Either:\n  1) Per-symbol daily close prices (or daily log/simple returns) for GOOGL, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, MSFT over 2025-02-18 to 2025-08-15, and\n  2) Portfolio weights (assume equal-weight 20% each if not provided).\n- Or:\n  - A single complete daily portfolio return series for the same date range, clearly labeled.\n- Optional (improves interpretation): risk-free rate (annual), market index returns (e.g., SPY) if you want beta as well.\n\nMethodology I will apply (once data are complete)\n- Frequency: daily; observations ~125.\n- Portfolio construction: if weights w, portfolio return r_p,t = \u03a3_i w_i r_i,t.\n- 1) Volatility (annualized, 20-day window): \u03c3_20a = stdev_20(r_p) \u00d7 sqrt(252).\n  - Signal thresholds (one-day annualized): LOW < 15%, MODERATE 15\u201330%, HIGH > 30%.\n- 2) Historical VaR (95%, 1-day): VaR_95 = \u2212quantile_0.05(r_p). Report as % of portfolio value.\n  - Thresholds: LOW < 1.2%, MODERATE 1.2\u20132.5%, HIGH > 2.5%.\n- 3) CVaR (95%): average loss of returns \u2264 VaR threshold. CVaR_95 = \u2212E[r_p | r_p \u2264 q_5%].\n  - Thresholds: LOW < 2.0%, MODERATE 2.0\u20133.5%, HIGH > 3.5%.\n- 4) Maximum drawdown: from cumulative return curve C_t = \u03a0(1 + r_p,t); DD_t = 1 \u2212 C_t / peak(C_\u2264t); Max DD = max(DD_t).\n  - Thresholds over window: LOW < 8%, MODERATE 8\u201320%, HIGH > 20%.\n- 5) Correlation risk (multi-asset):\n  - Compute pairwise correlation matrix of symbol returns; report average pairwise correlation \u03c1\u0304 and first principal component (concentration).\n  - Thresholds: LOW \u03c1\u0304 < 0.3, MODERATE 0.3\u20130.6, HIGH > 0.6 and/or >50% variance in PC1.\n- 6) Liquidity risk:\n  - Average daily dollar volume (ADV) per symbol = mean(price \u00d7 volume).\n  - Amihud illiquidity: mean(|r_i,t| / DollarVolume_i,t); portfolio-level as weighted average.\n  - Thresholds (large-cap US): LOW if ADV > $500m and Amihud < 1e-6; MODERATE if ADV $100\u2013500m or Amihud 1e-6\u20131e-5; HIGH otherwise.\n\nPreliminary qualitative assessment based on composition (not a substitute for calculation)\n- Symbols: GOOGL, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, MSFT are mega-cap, highly liquid US tech/AI leaders.\n  - Liquidity risk: LOW (very high ADV; tight spreads).\n  - Correlation/concentration risk: LIKELY HIGH (these names tend to co-move, especially in risk-off or AI-factor shocks). Final level to confirm with data.\n  - Market risk: Could be MODERATE to HIGH depending on recent volatility; requires computation.\n\nRisk signals framework (what you will receive after computation)\n- Volatility signal: LOW/MODERATE/HIGH based on \u03c3_20a thresholds.\n- Tail risk signals:\n  - VaR_95 breach rate vs. expected 5% (Kupiec POF optional).\n  - CVaR_95/ VaR_95 ratio (tail heaviness): >1.4 indicates fatter tails.\n- Drawdown signal: Current DD level and Max DD over the window.\n- Correlation signal: \u03c1\u0304, PC1 variance share, and marginal contribution to risk by name.\n- Liquidity signal: ADV bucket and Amihud; flag any deterioration.\n\nActionable recommendations (preliminary, pending numbers)\n- Reduce concentration risk: cap single-name weights, introduce diversifiers with lower correlation (e.g., non-tech sectors, non-US, duration, commodities).\n- Tail risk mitigation: set loss limits informed by 95% CVaR; consider put spreads or collars around earnings/major events.\n- Volatility targeting: scale exposure if \u03c3_20a exceeds your risk budget.\n- Liquidity hygiene: use VWAP/TWAP and limit orders; avoid trading around illiquid times even though names are liquid.\n- Monitoring: daily check on VaR/CVaR and drawdown; alert on \u03c1\u0304 spike (>0.6) or VaR exceptions >7 in 100 days.\n\nNext step\n- Please provide:\n  - Either the full per-symbol daily close (or returns) for GOOGL, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, MSFT over the stated dates, plus weights; or a complete daily portfolio return series.\n  - If you want beta as an extra, include a market proxy (e.g., SPY returns).\n- As soon as I have that, I will compute and deliver the exact metrics and risk-level signals."
