====================
Alpha Agent Pool
====================

Overview
--------

The **Alpha Agent Pool** serves as the strategy engine of the FinAgent Orchestration system. These agents are responsible for **hypothesis generation, signal fusion, and tactical portfolio recommendations**, acting as autonomous financial analysts and strategists.

Design Objectives
------------------

- Generate diverse, hypothesis-driven trading signals.
- Enable peer cooperation and strategy ensemble methods.
- Embed domain priors and risk constraints into reasoning flows.
- Maintain explainability, traceability, and adaptivity over time.

Agent Specialization
---------------------

Alpha Agents are instantiated with different modeling philosophies, horizons, and alpha hypotheses. Representative types include:

- **MomentumAlphaAgent**: Uses trend continuation signals and technical breakouts.
- **MeanReversionAgent**: Detects overbought/oversold patterns and local reversions.
- **LLMAlphaAgent**: Fuses structured data with unstructured news for language-conditioned decisions.
- **MultiFactorAlphaAgent**: Combines value, growth, quality, and sentiment signals in ranked alpha scores.

Theoretical Framework
---------------------

The Alpha Agent Pool operates on the foundation of **multi-agent reinforcement learning** and **ensemble methods** for alpha generation. Each agent maintains:

1. **Signal Generation Models**: Proprietary algorithms for feature extraction and pattern recognition
2. **Risk-Return Optimization**: Portfolio construction with dynamic risk budgeting
3. **Confidence Calibration**: Bayesian updating mechanisms for signal reliability assessment
4. **Temporal Consistency**: State-space models for maintaining strategic coherence across time horizons

Mathematical Formulation
------------------------

For agent :math:`i`, the alpha signal generation and adaptive learning process are formulated as follows:

.. math::

   \alpha_i(t; w^*_i) = f_i(\mathbf{X}_t, \mathbf{H}_{t-1}, \theta_i, w^*_i) + \epsilon_i(t)

where:
- :math:`\mathbf{X}_t` denotes the feature matrix at time :math:`t`;
- :math:`\mathbf{H}_{t-1}` is the historical context;
- :math:`\theta_i` are agent-specific parameters;
- :math:`w^*_i` is the optimal momentum window (or hyperparameter) adaptively selected by reinforcement learning;
- :math:`\epsilon_i(t)` captures model uncertainty.

**Momentum Agent RL-based Window Selection**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The MomentumAlphaAgent employs a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to adaptively select the optimal momentum window :math:`w^*_i` for signal generation. The RL process is as follows:

1. **Q-Learning Update**

   Each candidate window :math:`w` is treated as an action. The agent maintains a Q-table :math:`Q(w)` updated according to observed returns :math:`r_t(w)`:

   .. math::
      Q(w) \leftarrow Q(w) + \eta \left[ r_t(w) - Q(w) \right]

   where :math:`\eta` is the learning rate. The window with the highest Q-value is selected:

   .. math::
      w^*_i = \arg\max_w Q(w)

2. **Policy Gradient Update**

   Alternatively, the agent may maintain a probability distribution :math:`\pi(w)` over windows, updated via policy gradient based on the advantage :math:`A(w) = \bar{r}(w) - b` (where :math:`b` is a baseline):

   .. math::
      \pi(w) \leftarrow \pi(w) + \eta \cdot A(w)

   followed by normalization. The window is then sampled according to :math:`\pi(w)`.

3. **Backtest Feedback Integration**

   After each backtest, the agent computes per-window average returns and other metrics (e.g., IC, IR, win rate), and updates :math:`Q(w)` or :math:`\pi(w)` accordingly. The optimal window :math:`w^*_i` is then used for subsequent signal generation.

**Ensemble Aggregation**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ensemble alpha is computed as:

.. math::

   \alpha_{ensemble}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i(t) \cdot \alpha_i(t; w^*_i)

where weights :math:`w_i(t)` are determined by recent risk-adjusted performance, e.g.,

.. math::

   w_i(t) = \frac{\exp(\gamma \cdot \text{Sharpe}_i(t-\tau:t))}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(\gamma \cdot \text{Sharpe}_j(t-\tau:t))}

This framework enables the agent pool to adaptively mine momentum factors and optimize signal quality via continual RL-based feedback and meta-learning.

Agent Coordination Protocols
----------------------------

**Cooperative Signaling**: Agents exchange intermediate signals through structured message passing, enabling:
- **Signal Fusion**: Weighted combination of complementary alpha sources
- **Conflict Resolution**: Voting mechanisms for contradictory signals
- **Information Sharing**: Cross-agent feature importance propagation

**Competitive Learning**: Agents compete for allocation based on risk-adjusted returns, fostering:
- **Strategy Diversification**: Evolutionary pressure toward uncorrelated alpha sources
- **Parameter Optimization**: Continuous hyperparameter tuning through performance feedback
- **Adaptive Specialization**: Dynamic role assignment based on market regime detection

Architecture and Protocol
--------------------------

Multi-Agent System Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Alpha Agent Pool implements a **distributed consensus architecture** where agents operate both independently and collaboratively. The system architecture comprises:

- **Agent Registry**: Centralized discovery and metadata management
- **Communication Bus**: Asynchronous message passing for inter-agent coordination  
- **Orchestration Layer**: MCP-based workflow management and task allocation
- **Memory Subsystem**: Shared knowledge base and experience replay buffers

**Communication**: Agents operate under **MCP** orchestration and may perform **A2A collaboration** through signal exchange, ensembling, or voting mechanisms.
**Strategy Lifecycle**: Agents receive structured data contexts and respond with ranked actions, signal scores, or executable plans.
**Feedback and Memory**: Each alpha decision is logged with contextual evidence, contributing to model evaluation and continual learning.

Signal Processing Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The alpha generation pipeline follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Real-time market data, fundamental metrics, and alternative datasets
2. **Feature Engineering**: Transformation of raw data into predictive features
3. **Signal Generation**: Agent-specific alpha computation and ranking
4. **Risk Adjustment**: Integration of risk constraints and portfolio considerations
5. **Output Standardization**: Normalization and scaling for ensemble compatibility

.. math::

   \text{Pipeline}: \mathbf{D}_{raw} \xrightarrow{FE} \mathbf{X}_t \xrightarrow{SG} \alpha_i(t) \xrightarrow{RA} \tilde{\alpha}_i(t) \xrightarrow{OS} \hat{\alpha}_i(t)

Performance Attribution Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Agent performance is continuously monitored through:

- **Information Coefficient (IC)**: Correlation between predicted and realized returns
- **Information Ratio (IR)**: Risk-adjusted alpha generation capability  
- **Hit Rate**: Frequency of directionally correct predictions
- **Turnover Analysis**: Trading frequency and associated transaction costs

The attribution model decomposes performance as:

.. math::

   R_{agent} = \alpha_{pure} + \beta_{market} \cdot R_{market} + \sum_{f} \beta_f \cdot R_f + \epsilon

Advanced Learning Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Meta-Learning**: Agents employ **learning-to-learn** approaches for rapid adaptation to new market regimes:

.. math::

   \theta^* = \arg\min_\theta \sum_{task} \mathcal{L}_{task}(f_\theta, \mathcal{D}_{support}, \mathcal{D}_{query})

**Continual Learning**: Prevention of catastrophic forgetting through:
- **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** for parameter importance preservation
- **Progressive Neural Networks** for expanding model capacity
- **Memory-Augmented Networks** for episodic knowledge retention

**Adversarial Training**: Robustness enhancement through:
- **Generative Adversarial Networks** for synthetic data augmentation
- **Domain Adversarial Training** for regime-invariant features
- **Adversarial Examples** for stress testing and validation

Design Principles
------------------

**Autonomous Hypothesis Testing**: Agents are capable of independently proposing and validating ideas.
**Ensemble Construction**: Results from multiple agents are integrated via weighted voting, reward history, or confidence propagation.
**Risk-Constrained Execution**: Generated signals are shaped by constraints passed from the Execution Layer or Risk Manager.

Alpha Agent Pool API Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Alpha Agent Pool exposes a modular and extensible interface for the orchestration, evaluation, and deployment of autonomous alpha-generating agents. The core interface is designed to support:

- **Strategy Flow Execution**: Standardized ingestion and execution of agent-generated strategy flows.
- **Backtesting and Evaluation**: Seamless integration with historical data for robust performance attribution.
- **Risk and Portfolio Constraints**: Embedding of domain-specific risk controls and position sizing logic.
- **Explainability and Traceability**: Full audit trail of agent decisions, signal provenance, and performance feedback.

**Strategy Flow Template**

A strategy flow is a structured, machine-readable artifact (typically JSON) that encodes the agent's trading decisions, confidence scores, predicted returns, and contextual reasoning for each decision epoch. The canonical format includes:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "alpha_id": "agent_001",
     "timestamp": "2025-07-15T12:00:00Z",
     "market_context": {
         "symbol": "AAPL",
         "regime_tag": "bull",
         "input_features": { "feature1": 1.23, "feature2": 4.56 }
     },
     "decision": {
         "signal": "BUY",
         "confidence": 0.87,
         "predicted_return": 0.021,
         "reasoning": "Momentum signal strong across multiple timeframes; regime is bullish; volatility low.",
         "asset_scope": ["AAPL"],
         "risk_estimate": 0.12
     },
     "performance_feedback": {
         "status": "pending",
         "evaluation_link": null
     },
     "metadata": {
         "generator_agent": "MomentumAlphaAgent",
         "strategy_prompt": "multi-timeframe momentum RL",
         "code_hash": "abc123def456",
         "context_id": "ctx_20250715"
     }
   }

This template ensures that all agent outputs are standardized for downstream execution and evaluation.

Backtesting Workflow
---------------------

The Alpha Agent Pool supports rigorous, reproducible backtesting of strategy flows using historical market data. The backtesting engine is designed to:

- Parse and validate agent-generated strategy flows.
- Simulate trade execution under realistic market conditions (including slippage, transaction costs, and position constraints).
- Compute a comprehensive suite of performance metrics (e.g., cumulative return, annualized return, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, IC/IR).
- Log all trades, portfolio states, and decision rationales for post-hoc analysis.

**Standard Backtest Command**

The following command executes a backtest using a pre-generated strategy flow and historical market data:

.. code-block:: bash

   python execute_strategy_trades.py \
       --strategy_flow /Users/lijifeng/Documents/AI_agent/FinAgent-Orchestration/FinAgents/agent_pools/alpha_agent_pool/alpha_agent_pool/data/strategy_flow_20250714_010320.json \
       --market_data /Users/lijifeng/Documents/AI_agent/FinAgent-Orchestration/data/cache/AAPL_2022-06-30_2025-06-29_1d.csv \
       --symbol AAPL \
       --initial_cash 1000000 \
       --visualize

This workflow ensures that the agent's decision logic is evaluated in a controlled, transparent, and reproducible manner.

**Automated Alpha Pool Testing**

For systematic evaluation of the Alpha Agent Pool across multiple datasets and parameterizations, the following test harness is provided:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 FinAgents/agent_pools/alpha_agent_pool/tests/test_alpha_pool_client.py \
       --dataset_path /Users/lijifeng/Documents/AI_agent/FinAgent-Orchestration/data/cache/AAPL_2022-06-30_2025-06-29_1d.csv \
       --symbol AAPL \
       --lookback 30 \
       --initial_cash 1000000

This enables batch testing, cross-validation, and benchmarking of agent variants under consistent experimental protocols.

**Best Practices**

- All strategy flows should be versioned and accompanied by metadata for full traceability.
- Backtest results must be archived with complete logs and parameter settings.
- Performance attribution should include both absolute and risk-adjusted metrics.
- The interface is designed for extensibility, supporting future integration with live trading and reinforcement learning pipelines.

Detailed API Specification
-------------------------

Alpha Agent Pool Interface Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Alpha Agent Pool interface is designed to be both human- and machine-readable, supporting robust integration with agent development, orchestration, and evaluation pipelines. Below, we provide a detailed breakdown of the API, including data schemas, field semantics, and interaction protocols.

**1. Strategy Flow Input Schema**

Each strategy flow submitted to the pool must conform to the following schema:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "alpha_id": "string",
     "version": "string",
     "timestamp": "2025-07-15T12:00:00Z",
     "market_context": {
         "symbol": "string",
         "regime_tag": "string",
         "input_features": { "feature1": 1.23, "feature2": 4.56 }
     },
     "decision": {
         "signal": "BUY|SELL|HOLD",
         "confidence": 0.0,
         "predicted_return": 0.0,
         "risk_estimate": 0.0,
         "reasoning": "string",
         "asset_scope": ["string"]
     },
     "performance_feedback": {
         "status": "pending|evaluated|rejected",
         "evaluation_link": null
     },
     "metadata": {
         "generator_agent": "string",
         "strategy_prompt": "string",
         "code_hash": "string",
         "context_id": "string"
     }
   }

**Field Descriptions:**
- `alpha_id`: Unique identifier for the agent or strategy instance.
- `version`: Version string for traceability and reproducibility.
- `timestamp`: ISO8601-formatted UTC timestamp of the decision.
- `market_context`: Encapsulates all relevant market state, including symbol, regime, and engineered features.
- `decision`: The core output, including the trading signal, confidence, predicted return, risk estimate, and human-readable reasoning.
- `performance_feedback`: Status and links for post-trade evaluation and feedback loops.
- `metadata`: Provenance and reproducibility information for audit and research.

**2. API Interaction Protocol**

- **Submission**: Agents submit strategy flows via a RESTful endpoint, file drop, or direct function call, depending on deployment context.
- **Validation**: The pool validates schema compliance, field ranges, and logical consistency (e.g., confidence in [0,1], signal in allowed set).
- **Execution**: Validated flows are passed to the backtesting or live execution engine, which simulates or implements the trades as specified.
- **Feedback**: After execution, performance metrics and logs are attached to the original flow for agent learning and audit.

**3. Output and Logging**

- **Trade Log**: Every executed trade is recorded with timestamp, action, size, price, and resulting portfolio state.
- **Performance Report**: After backtest, a JSON report is generated containing summary statistics (CR, ARR, Sharpe, MDD, IC, IR, etc.), full trade logs, and decision rationales.
- **Error Handling**: If a flow fails validation or execution, a structured error message is returned, including error type, offending field, and suggested remediation.

**4. Extensibility and Customization**

- The interface supports additional fields in `market_context`, `decision`, and `metadata` for custom agent logic, new asset classes, or research features.
- Agents may include additional signals (e.g., stop-loss, take-profit, position sizing) as optional fields, provided they are documented in the metadata.
- The API is versioned to ensure backward compatibility as new features are introduced.
